  "landing.boundaries_title": "Standard Boundaries",
  "landing.boundaries_desc": "The standard boundaries are: Red\u2192Orange at 18\u00b0, Orange\u2192Yellow at 48\u00b0, Yellow\u2192Green at 78\u00b0, Green\u2192Blue at 163\u00b0, Blue\u2192Violet at 258\u00b0, Violet\u2192Pink at 300\u00b0, and Pink\u2192Red at 345\u00b0 on the HSL color wheel. These values come from the XKCD color survey (N=222,500), the Munsell color system, and CIE colorimetry research.",
  "landing.reliability_title": "Ensuring Accuracy",
  "landing.reliability_desc": "The test employs several psychometric techniques: practice trials before scoring begins, randomized boundary order to prevent priming, left-right counterbalancing to cancel position bias, a neutral gray interstitial between questions to reset color adaptation, and adaptive step expansion for oscillating responses.",
